<h1> Getting to grips with grammar!... </h1> 

<p> So as dull as it sounds, we really need to make sure we have the right grammar so we can show off all the Spanish that we have learnt. You can't ask someone where the hotel is if you don't know how to say 'it is'! Without going into too much detail, we are going to show you how to conjugate verbs and use pronouns so that even though the Spanish you have learnt is minor, it will get you great results around the world! <p>
