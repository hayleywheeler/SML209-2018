  <p> In Spanish, verbs change depending on who the subject of the sentence is. In English, we do not have such strict verb conjugtions but the gist is still similar. For example, I do, you do, he does, she does, we do and they do. See how for he and she 'do' becomes 'does'? This is how it works in Spanish. There are three different verb patterns. Verbs that take -er, -ar and -ir in their infinitive form (like the infinitive verb 'to do' in English). Below are the verb tables. You do not need to learn them all for your holibobs, no worries, still it's good to keep this in mind should you want to learn them!
